      <h2>Te Whare Tapa Whā - My Wellbeing Plan</h2>
      <h3>Core - Sprint 4 - 8/4/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>

      <h4>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h4>
      <p>
        Going to lightsaber dueling and flow classes every Wednesday evening.<br />
        Walking to get public transport everywhere as I don't drive.
      </p>
      <h4>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</h4>
      <p>
        Eating dinner and enjoying some entertainment together with my home
        family most nights<br />
        Having family dinner at my parents place at least once every two weeks
      </p>
      <h4>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h4>
      <p>
        Doing a quick follow along meditation in the mornings<br />
        Reading a chapter or a short part of something fiction and something
        non-fiction from my reading list most nights before bed.
      </p>
      <h4>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h4>
      <p>Digital hand written journaling most nights before bed.</p>
      <h4>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h4>
      <p>
        Walking to buses and trains, I wear barefoot shoes for medical reasons,
        this helps me feel "grounded" too.<br />
        Working with my windows open for fresh air.<br />
        Whenever I'm at my parents house once every week or so it's rural,
        amongst grass, bush etc. I'm always roped into helping do or fix
        something outside.
