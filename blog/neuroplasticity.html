      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <h3>Core - Sprint 4 - 8/4/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <h4>
        How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
      </h4>
      <p>
        It can boost confidence in your ability to learn and grow.<br />
        It will Increase motivation, When we see that our brains can change and
        grow in response to our habits and actions, we are more willing to put
        in the hard work and hours.<br />
        It also helps you view challenges as opportunities and chances for
        growth and new skills rather than too hard obstacles!
      </p>

      <h4>
        How to engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit
      </h4>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practice saying "Yet" instead of "can't"</li>
        <li>
          The more we repeat a new skill, habit or behavior, the stronger the
          neural pathways become.
        </li>
        <li>
          Getting more sleep so that my brain actually has time to consolidate
          the memories and neural pathways will also help.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Growth mindset</h4>
      <h4>What is it and why is it relevant?</h4>
      <p>
        It keeps you motivated to keep growing, to become a better person, to do
        more good.<br />
        It keeps stress, anxiety, and depression at bay.<br />
        In general people with a growth mindset believe they can improve in any
        area with effort.
      </p>

      <h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>
      <p>
        Not really, this is all things my parents have been drilling into me
        since I was old enough to understand. <br />
        I'm starting to see this may be different for other people. It doesn't
        look like this was talked enough about in kiwi primary, and intermediate
        schools.

      <h4>How to integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey</h4>
      <p>
        There are a number of things you can do to integrate a growth mindset
        into your learning journey:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Focus on effort over outcome, celebrating the hard work and
          perseverance in things that challenge me, even if I donâ€™t achieve
          perfect results.
        </li>
        <li>
          When I notice mistakes, use "oops, I don't have that quite yet"
          instead of "I'll never get that"
        </li>
      </ul>

        One of the first things my family showed me about a growth mindset would
        be this music video from Barbie. I unironically love it.
