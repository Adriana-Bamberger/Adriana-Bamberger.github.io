      <h2>BootCamp Learning Plan</h2>
      <h3>Core - Sprint 2 - 31/3/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <p>
        I have a short-term goal and a long-term idea.<br />
        In five years, I would love to be able to work at least part time remotely, learn new
        things, and be employed by a company that is positively impacting the
        world. In five years or more, anything could happen but I would like to
        spend some time in the Austrian alps, working in the mornings and skiing
        in the evenings.<br /><br />

        I don't believe my strengths and limitations have changed that much.<br />
        I still have determination to prove myself.<br />
        I still love challenges.<br />
        My strong sense of justice is still in tact.<br />
        I'm definitely still extroverted in that I love meeting new people and
        making new friends and connections.<br />
        I'm decisive,<br />
        I still have and value direct communication.<br /><br />

        My limitations are similar; I can still be blunt and/or stubborn.<br />
        I still lack strong sense of focus I can get distracted easily.<br />
        I still struggle to detect sarcasm.<br />
        And even though I love my strong sense of justice, this could still come
        back to bite me.<br /><br />

        My biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be my tendency to
        get distracted at the smallest thing, If I'm not fully interested in
        what I've sat down to do, my brain searches for serotonin triggers,
        leading to wandering thoughts of costume designs, fabrics, business
        ideas, fun colors, patterns and textures in the environment around me,
        quite literary anything, even a blank wall.<br /><br />

        In bootcamp, I'd love to work on pair coding, giving and receiving
        helpful kind feedback, and Improving my concentration.<br /><br />

        My expectations from the team have not changed.<br />
        I expect support when I ask for it, a watchful eye to make sure I'm on
        track, and creative, constructive input always.<br />
        I also expect everyone to have different styles of humor. I'm looking
        forward to meeting everyone in person.<br /><br /><br />

        During bootcamp, I expect to do the following to help myself stay on
        track with the fast-paced work.<br />

        Pre-planning out my time in my google calendar as per our given schedule
        with time blocking,<br />
        During the day, using toggler to measure the actual time I spent of
        different things,<br />
        And the end of the day, I go back and adjust my calendar to what I
        actually did. (This helps me see my patterns in work flow, what I'm
        faster at vs. slower at and my progress.)<br /><br />
        To keep my self from getting distracted when I think of something
        distracting I will pause my timer if I think it will take more than a a
        minute to type, I have a preset quick button on my stream deck to pull
        up my "to do later" list in notion, quickly type it out their and then
        close the window. I've noticed that this has been able to effectively
        solve the random ideas getting me distracted problem so far.<br /><br />

        To keep up and seek help in a timely way I will be conscious to make
        sure I am staying on track with time allotted so that I don't work
        overtime, and reach out in the appropriate channels before it comes to
        that.<br /><br />

        Most importantly, I will ask for help as soon as I have spent 10 minutes
        trying to work it out by myself or I realize google can not help me -
        whichever comes first.<br />
        In so many words, I can use "Hey [persons-or-groups-name], would you be
        able to help me to…."<br />
        By putting the allotted times into my Google Calendar, I can see them in
        Toggler next to the actual current tracking time. This way, I can see in
        the same screen how I'm progressing.

        Pre-planning out my time in a active calendar with time blocking, 30/60
        min to 5/10 min breaks Pomodoro timer style. <br />
        Being transparent with people how much time I have to spend on whatever
        we are doing.<br />
        I will be conscious to make sure I am staying on track with time
        allotted so that I don't work overtime, reach out in the appropriate
        channels before it comes to that.<br />
        When things a re building up and I need to step away, I can do so by
        letting the appropriate people know that is what I'm doing, setting my
        status as such in the right channels, putting my computer to sleep
        <br />
        (I will still receive important notifications on my phone) <br />
        And physically stepping out of my study/computer space. <br />
        Sewing, op-shoping and exercising with friends are my big re-set
        activities.<br />
        Most importantly I will ask for help as soon as I have spent 10 min
        trying to work it out by myself or I realize google can not help me -
        whichever comes first.

      <p>
        Wednesday nights I spend at lightsaber fight and flow training, <br />
        During the week once or twice I try to see my partner for a lunch or
        dinner date, however we fit this around study as we're both in heavy
        study. <br />
        Sunday nights I travel across Auckland 2 hours via bus for family dinner
        - I have years of practice of working and reading on public transport,
        so this is just more study or relaxing time, whichever I need on the
        time.
