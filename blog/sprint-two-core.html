      <h2>Identity and Values</h2>
      <h3>Core - Sprint 2 - 31/3/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
      <p>In 5 years, working from anywhere, learning more and working for a company that is going good for the world would be ideal.
        Furter than 5 years anything could happen.</p>
      <h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h4>
      <h4>Strengths</h4>
      <p>Pure determination to prove myself,<br>
        I love challenges,<br>
        Strong sense of justice,<br>
        Extroverted, <br>
        Interest in building community and making friends,<br>
        Decisive,<br>
        Direct communication.</p>
      <h4>Limitations</h4>
      <p>Sometimes blunt or stubborn.<br>
        Hyper-focused-ability<br>
        Lack of understanding of sarcasm styles.<br>
        My strong sense of justice</p>
      <h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
      <p>	I would love to become a better communicator and leader, both with the physical methods and the confidence to do so quicker without thinking about it.
        <br> I want to be a excellent community member.
      </p>
      <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h4>
      <p> Pre-planning out my time in a active calendar with time blocking, 30/60 min to 5/10 min breaks Pomodoro timer style. <br>
        Being transparent with people how much time I have to spend on whatever we are doing.<br>
        I will be conscious to make sure I am staying on track with time allotted so that I don't work overtime, reach out in the appropriate channels before it comes to that.<br>
      	When things a re building up and I need to step away, I can do so by letting the appropriate people know that is what I'm doing, setting my status as such in the right channels, putting my computer to sleep <br>
        (I will still receive important notifications on my phone) <br>
        And physically stepping out of my study/computer space. <br>
        Sewing, op-shoping and exercising with friends are my big re-set activities.<br>
        Most importantly I will ask for help as soon as I have spent 10 min trying to work it out by myself or I realize google can not help me - whichever comes first.</p>
      <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h4>
      <p>I expect support when I ask for it, a watchful eye making sure I'm on track when in person bootcamp, and creative constructive input always.<br>
         I also expect everyone to have different styles of humor. I'm looking forward to meeting everyone in person.</p>
      <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h4>
      <p>	Wednesday nights I spend at lightsaber fight and flow training, <br>
          During the week once or twice I try to see my partner for a lunch or dinner date, however we fit this around study as we're both in heavy study. <br>
          Sunday nights I travel across Auckland 2 hours via bus for family dinner - I have years of practice of working and reading on public transport, so this is just more study or relaxing time, whichever I need on the time.</p>
