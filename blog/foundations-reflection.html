      <h2>Foundations Reflection</h2>
      <h3>Core - Sprint 5 - 19/4/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <h4>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h4>
      <p>
        I am more easily distracted than I thought I was.<br />
        Less ego, more pride and thankfulness for my parents' style of
        homeschooling.<br />
        I haven't really sat down to think about my values much before, learning
        the names for the emotions was fun.
      </p>

      <h4>
        What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
        and programming?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Values are your moral compass. If you're building an app; Is it secure,
        does it keep extra data, Will everyone be able to use it, even grandma,
        is it doing good for the world?<br />
        Empathy is thinking of the people who will use your code. <br />
        What will they (the user) find hard to use vs easy to use? <br />
        Basically, to be able to get in your users' heads (in a good way) makes
        your websites, apps etc' better. <br />
        Self-awareness is how you keep yourself in check. <br />
        Are we great at debugging ? <br />
        Or does JavaScript make our brain hurt? <br />
        It's knowing what you're good at, asking for help when you get stuck.
        And learning from your mistakes.
      </p>

      <h4>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h4>
      <p>
        How much of it made complete sense.<br />
        If it wasn't something I wasn't already completely confident about, it
        seemed to make complete sense. <br /><br />

        I expected it to be much harder, in the end the hardest part of the core
        for me was staying concentrated and reading the whole thing in detail
        rather than skim reading when I felt like I already knew the material.
        <br />
        <br />

        I have a newfound sense of gratefulness to how my parents homeschooled
        me, installing a lot of these practices of just in time learning,
        flipped classroom set up and believing you can learn anything from as
        early as I can remember. <br /><br />

        I appreciate much more now why they chose to do homeschooling the way
        they did.
      </p>

      <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
      <p>
        What I just mentioned and; <br />
        Remembering to meditate, <br />
        Being able to sit completely still for those 5 min.<br />
        At first I was skeptical about meditating as I've seen it as rather
        wishy-washy in the past, it's yet to make a difference but I'll keep
        trying as science hasn't failed me yet.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h4>
      <p>
        If we can not be active team members, work smoothly and nicely with all
        kinds of people, then we will not be useful or wanted in a company. Full
        stop.<br />
        Any good company would not want to take on the risks that come with an
        emotionally unintelligent person. <br />
        When you have a company that relies more on its people for growth and
        general existence, rather than any kind of machinery then these people
        must not become things holding you back. <br />
        The customers and users are already fragile enough variables we do not
        need to make the team a fragile variable too.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h4>

      <p>
        Absolutely not, I have loved learning about the terms,<br />
        Getting to know some of my "funny little habits" and family jokes ("Is
        google broken?") are actually useful skills that I should work more
        with, and finding more habits to teach myself has been great.<br /><br />

        learning more about the rest of the worlds perspective from a brief
        mention in the discord was very eye opening, I binged a few videos on
        you tube, and was saddened to see that videos from more than a year ago
        make it sound like a mythical thing that only some people can attain,
        the newer videos aren't much better. <br />
        There's lots of videos and writing about the idea of it, but not so much
        about the things you can do to learn it and practice using it in your
        day to day life.<br /><br />

        While pair programming is great, I don't think we should be spending all
        of our time coding right now, if we didn't have the core parts I would
        have opted to do the part time course so that I could have time to still
        get exercise and have some balance in my life, I value spending time
        with friends, my family, the outdoors, and being active. If we were
        coding all the time I don't think my mental health would be able to take
        it and I wouldn't achieve the results I'd want to get in the same amount
        of sit down study time.
