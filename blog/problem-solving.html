      <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
      <h3>Tech - Sprint 4 - 14/4/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <p>
        This last week has been a mental doosey for me,<br />
        I went in feeling confident for another week of learning, sure that
        while I can't remember things off the top of my head right now, it
        wouldn't be an issue later; I'd get it eventually, I just need to keep
        working on it.<br />
        Near the middle, when I started one of our modules, JavaScript Kata, I
        realized that even once I resorted to using Gemini's AI to explain the
        questions in different ways, it sounded like French and made zero
        sense.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        All of a sudden, nothing made sense. I felt stupid. I struggled with
        every single one of them.<br />
        For example, in the second series of questions “manipulating objects”
        <br />
        Looking back, there's probably a word for this type of coding where you
        don't add to the function within the function but call it instead.
        <br />
        I didn't think to look for that at the time, as the first one already
        had me feeling stupid.
      </p>

      <p>Each question on the document we were given asked something like:</p>
      <p>
        “// 7. Add a children key to terah and use object literal notation to
        assign this variable to an empty object.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This sounded like french to me still, and by this point I had remembered
        what a “key” was.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's a way of storing small bits of information, for example, the Date:
        6th of Jan, Time: 8pm pieces of information that are often on event
        invitations.
      </p>

      <p>
        I still had no idea what “object literal notation” was and reading
        “variable to an empty object.” made my brain feel like it was short
        circuiting.
      </p>

      <p>
        I googled “object literal notation” and got more french sounding
        sentences; even asking Gemini to explain what it was wasn't helpful. Now
        I'm stressed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Go for a walk to the kitchen, get some water, go back to it, and read it
        again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Same helpless feeling. At this point, I want to give up and go back to
        sewing.<br />
        I know how to do that; it's really fun. I can make things that I can
        actually touch and feel in the finished items. It makes me happy. I
        never feel stressed or stupid when I'm sewing, it's easy to say not yet
        when I can feel and see with my own eyes exactly what's wrong.
      </p>

      <p>I can't see what's wrong here; it's just wrong.</p>

      <p>
        In the end, the correct piece of code was: <br />
        terah.children = {}
      </p>

      <p>
        After sitting their for a good 5 minute in a loop of feeling like I need
        to cry - but not being able to, <br />
        Wanting to do anything else - but not being able to, as I also want to
        get this done,<br />
        Just sitting in my tiny space, feeling sad and stuck, I eventually gave
        in and tried the tools I knew how to use.<br />
        First,<br />
        Ai.
      </p>

      <p>
        I feel rotten for using it as much as I did this week, But without it, I
        truly feel like I wouldn't have gotten anywhere and just made myself
        feel worse.
      </p>

      <p>
        First I copied and pasted the question into gemini, asking it to please
        break down what it is the question is asking me to do, using other
        words.<br />
        When it spat out;<br />
        “Can you modify the terah information to include a new section called
        "children"? This new section should be empty for now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        This immediately made more sense and between the two, I could understand
        mostly what it wanted me to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was still stuck on what the heck “object literal notation” was, so I
        asked, <br />
        “For this problem, what would “object literal notation be?”
      </p>

      <p>
        It said;<br />
        “Object literal notation: This is a fancy way of saying how we write the
        information for the “terah” box. It involves curly braces {} and colons
        :”
      </p>

      <p>
        Great so this whole time I was duped by fancy words that mean the same
        thing as “key value pairs.”
      </p>

      <p>
        It felt like my brain just returned static no matter what part I
        searched or read, For awhile, it all felt like French going in one ear
        and out the other. My brain still feels like a dumb, slow, sieve.
      </p>

      <p>
        After trying a bunch of different orders of the different names and
        parts, one worked!.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don't think I learned much about the code, as, thinking back, I can't
        remember ANY of it.<br />
        But I learned more about using Google and Gemini to make things make
        sense to me.<br />
        I learned that if I'm not careful, Gemini will try to just give me the
        piece of code.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's not useful. I can't use that, so now I have to ask it to scrape
        that and ask it to help me understand it another way as we're not
        allowed to use it's code as per our policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        I do wonder if this is an accurate representation of the industry or
        not, <br />
        I see that we all want to make the best use of our time so if we can use
        ai to make the base part of the smaller chunks of code, as long as we
        understand what it is and how it is doing what it does, <br />
        (which I don't yet, so I understand this is why we can't use it yet.)<br />
        <br />
        If it saves us from typing for hours, would that not be a good tool to
        use? And what if it can teach us about better tools to use than the ones
        we knew about? That's really awesome.<br />
        <br />
        Of the other problem solving methods, I have also tried using
        pseudocode.<br />
        It feels just like how I take my notes, I didn't notice any difference.
        It still works great for mapping out what I need to do.<br /><br />

        I was “Trying something” all the time, like a loop, “try this, that part
        works, that part not yet, try that part again,” looping until it
        works.<br /><br />

        I tried the rubber ducky method on the first problem and the second to
        last problem in our javascript kata modules, using my little tiger soft
        toy I have sitting near my desk.<br />
        For the first one, I caught my own syntax fix and boom, it worked!<br /><br />

        For the second to last one, no matter how many times I read it out loud
        or compared it to the notes from one of our mentors, Gerard, I couldn't
        see any reason for it to be failing. <br /><br />

        In the end for this one, I copied and pasted the code into our after
        hours discord chat channel and a guy called Pete found my missing
        quotation marks.<br /><br />

        Reading error messages wasn't any help to me; it all sounded like
        French. <br />
        I tried the same thing that had saved me before asking Gemini to explain
        it in different, more basic words, but that made it more confusing.<br /><br />

        It asked for more details, so I gave it the question and instead of
        continuing to break it down,<br />
        It immediately returned to the top of a text box, I recognized that box
        from earlier and quickly exited before I could spoil it for myself.<br /><br />

        The question was hard enough. I didn't want to have to find an
        alternative, probably harder way to solve the question, just because I
        asked for help from AI incorrectly.<br /><br />

        Console.logging, I do not understand this at all, Amiee and I are going
        to spend time going over this together tonight/monday.<br /><br />

        Googling doesn't help as much as I thought it would, I have found
        google's AI way more useful when searching for “what is…….”<br /><br />

        Asking my peers for help, Amiee and I work together and bounce ideas off
        each other. <br /><br />

        Asking coaches for help is tricky; half the time I don't even know what
        is tripping me up, so by the time I've worked that out, I'm on a
        roll.<br /><br />

        Improving your process with reflection, This is the one thing I didn't
        do enough of this week, and I reckon it's what mostly made my stress
        levels this week different from the rest.<br /><br />

        I spent more time this week practicing meditation than journaling, and
        since I've been journaling for such a long time, maybe this was also a
        bit of a shock to my system to not work through the feelings in my head
        as much.<br /><br />

        In summary,<br />
        I feel stupid. <br />
        I'll be okay.<br />
        I'm thankful for Gemini, sewing, and my family.
