      <h2>The Story of Te Houtaewa</h2>
      <h3>A template from Dev Academy</h3>
      <p>
        Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on
        his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi
        (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a
        short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother
        to prepare the hangi. Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te
        Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people
        who lived there.
