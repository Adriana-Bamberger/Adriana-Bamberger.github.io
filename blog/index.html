      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <h3>Core - Sprint 4 - 8/4/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <h4>
        How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
      </h4>
      <p>
        It can boost confidence in your ability to learn and grow.<br />
        It will Increase motivation, When we see that our brains can change and
        grow in response to our habits and actions, we are more willing to put
        in the hard work and hours.<br />
        It also helps you view challenges as opportunities and chances for
        growth and new skills rather than too hard obstacles!

      <h2>JavaScript and the DOM</h2>
      <h3>Tech - Sprint 3 - 7/4/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <h4>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h4>
      <p>
        To help explain the three's connection we'll use an analogy.<br />
        Say we're building a playspace for our imaginary pet hamsters,<br />
        The HTML is the main structure, it's the tunnels, wheel, hammocks crawl
        spaces etc', And the cage that holds it all. <br />
        The CSS is the paint we've used, and the coloured dye we've used on the
        different pieces to make it look visually pleasing. <br />
        The JavaScript is the ball bearings we've used to make the wheel spin
        around and around, the parts that make the automatic feeder and drink
        station work.<br />
        Thus, in our website, <br />

      <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
      <h3>Core - Sprint 3 - 1/4/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
      <p>
        If emotions are like tennis balls, then emotional intelligence is if you
        could catch and control what you do with them, instead of getting
        smacked in the face.

        In 5 years, working from anywhere, learning more and working for a
        company that is going good for the world would be ideal. Furter than 5
        years anything could happen.

      <p>
        The Difference Between Padding, Border and Margin. <br />
        To help understand these three, I'll use a analogy of a painting on a
        gallery wall. <br />As the image below depicts. Our gallery wall is our
        webpage. <br />Our image is in a picture frame, A picture frame is made

      <h4>The Fallout From Friendship</h4>
      <p>
        Friendship is one of my important values. It has been installed in me
        from growing up in a small rural community, working in scouts with all
        kinds of people, you'll make all kinds of friends out of want or just
        dire circumstance from extreme bad weather. <br />
        Last year a friend makes a decision that challenged my values. it forced
        me to confront what was truly important to me in a friendship. <br />
        For several years, I had been part of a tight-knit group of friends. We
        went on and shared adventures, celebrated milestones, and were always
        there for each other even when we didn't all live close. <br />
        One member of the group, who we'll call T (25, F), had been a close
        friend for three years. When another friend, J (25, M), decided to move
        across the world to be with T, we were all very excited. <br />
        However, things changed shortly before J's arrival in Auckland from the
        UK.

      <h2>The Story of Te Houtaewa</h2>
      <h3>A template from Dev Academy</h3>
      <p>
        Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on
        his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi
        (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a
        short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother
        to prepare the hangi. Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te
        Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people
        who lived there.
