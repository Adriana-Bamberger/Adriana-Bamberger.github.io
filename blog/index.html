        live with an adorable dog Cassie. <br />
        Outside of coursework I make costumes, am a scout leader and do
        lightsaber flow. I like to go on adventures and Ski, I used to be a ski
        instructor before a injuary cut my abilty to ski for any lenght of time
        in half.<br />
        So far I am really enjoying the challenge of Dev Academy!<br />
        The below blog posts run from latest to oldest, <br />
        Each week I will add one or more posts about the tecnical things we have
        learnt and the "core" work we have done. This involves more person
        thinking and people skills.

      <h2>BootCamp Learning Plan</h2>
      <h3>Core - Sprint 2 - 31/3/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <p>
        I have a short-term goal and a long-term idea.<br />
        In five years, I would love to be able to work at least part time
        remotely, learn new things, and be employed by a company that is
        positively impacting the world. <br />
        In five years or more, anything could happen but I would like to spend
        some time in the Austrian alps, working in the mornings and skiing in
        the evenings.

      <h2>Foundations Reflection</h2>
      <h3>Core - Sprint 5 - 19/4/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <h4>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h4>
      <p>
        I am more easily distracted than I thought I was.<br />
        Less ego, more pride and thankfulness for my parents' style of
        homeschooling.<br />
        I haven't really sat down to think about my values much before, learning
        the names for the emotions was fun.

      <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
      <h3>Tech - Sprint 4 - 14/4/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <p>
        This last week has been a mental doosey for me,<br />
        I went in feeling confident for another week of learning, sure that
        while I can't remember things off the top of my head right now, it
        wouldn't be an issue later; I'd get it eventually, I just need to keep
        working on it.<br />
        Near the middle, when I started one of our modules, JavaScript Kata, I
        realized that even once I resorted to using Gemini's AI to explain the
        questions in different ways, it sounded like French and made zero
        sense.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        All of a sudden, nothing made sense. I felt stupid. I struggled with
        every single one of them.

      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <h3>Core - Sprint 4 - 8/4/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <h4>
        How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
      </h4>
      <p>
        It can boost confidence in your ability to learn and grow.<br />
        It will Increase motivation, When we see that our brains can change and
        grow in response to our habits and actions, we are more willing to put
        in the hard work and hours.<br />
        It also helps you view challenges as opportunities and chances for
        growth and new skills rather than too hard obstacles!

      <h2>JavaScript and the DOM</h2>
      <h3>Tech - Sprint 3 - 7/4/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <h4>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h4>
      <p>
        To help explain the three's connection we'll use an analogy.<br />
        Say we're building a playspace for our imaginary pet hamsters,<br />
        The HTML is the main structure, it's the tunnels, wheel, hammocks crawl
        spaces etc', And the cage that holds it all. <br />
        The CSS is the paint we've used, and the coloured dye we've used on the
        different pieces to make it look visually pleasing. <br />
        The JavaScript is the ball bearings we've used to make the wheel spin
        around and around, the parts that make the automatic feeder and drink
        station work.<br />
        Thus, in our website, <br />

      <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
      <h3>Core - Sprint 3 - 1/4/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
      <p>
        If emotions are like tennis balls, then emotional intelligence is if you
        could catch and control what you do with them, instead of getting
        smacked in the face.

        In 5 years, working from anywhere, learning more and working for a

        The Difference Between Padding, Border and Margin. <br />
        To help understand these three, I'll use a analogy of a painting on a
        gallery wall. <br />As the image below depicts. Our gallery wall is our

      <h2>Identity and Values</h2>
      <h3>Core - Sprint 1 - 31/3/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <h4>The Fallout From Friendship</h4>
      <p>
        Friendship is one of my important values. It has been installed in me
        from growing up in a small rural community, working in scouts with all
        kinds of people, you'll make all kinds of friends out of want or just
        dire circumstance from extreme bad weather. <br />
        Last year a friend makes a decision that challenged my values. it forced
        me to confront what was truly important to me in a friendship. <br />
        For several years, I had been part of a tight-knit group of friends. We
        went on and shared adventures, celebrated milestones, and were always
        there for each other even when we didn't all live close. <br />
        One member of the group, who we'll call T (25, F), had been a close
        friend for three years. When another friend, J (25, M), decided to move
        across the world to be with T, we were all very excited. <br />
        However, things changed shortly before J's arrival in Auckland from the
        UK.

      <h2>The Story of Te Houtaewa</h2>
      <h3>A template from Dev Academy</h3>
      <p>
        Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on
        his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi
        (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a
        short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother
        to prepare the hangi. Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te
        Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people
        who lived there.
