      <h2>Identity and Values</h2>
      <h3>Core - Sprint 1 - 31/3/2024 - Dev Academy Foundations</h3>
      <h4> The Fallout From Friendship </h4>
      <p>Friendship is one of my important values. It has been installed in me from  growing up in a small rural community, working in scouts with all kinds of people, you'll make all kinds of friends out of want or just dire circumstance from extreme bad weather. <br>
        Last year a friend makes a decision that challenged my values. it forced me to confront what was truly important to me in a friendship. <br>
        For several years, I had been part of a tight-knit group of friends. We went on and shared adventures, celebrated milestones, and were always there for each other even when we didn't all live close. <br>
        One member of the group, who we'll call T (25, F), had been a close friend for three years. When another friend, J (25, M), decided to move across the world to be with T, we were all very excited. <br>
        However, things changed shortly before J's arrival in Auckland from the UK. <br>
        We discover T has began a relationship with O, an 18-year-old who was flat mates with two of our friends. <br>
        The age difference (18 + 25 nearly 26) made many of us uncomfortable, but we didn't speak up incase it would damage the friendship. <br>
        We hoped that maybe it was a one night fling and things would soon go back to normal. J was due to land that next weekend, T had been talking about them for years. <Br>
        Unfortunately, things didn't change. <br>
        T continued her relationship with O, and it became clear that she was prioritizing it over her friendships and J. <br>
        Clearly this made things awkward and painful for J when he landed in NZ. <br>
        T, another one of our friends, and J where flatting together, verbal abuse grew and culminated in a situation where T lashed out at the entire group online, cut off contact and moved out of the flat for a month. <br>
        In the aftermath of this fallout, my friends and I was left feeling hurt, confused, and betrayed. <br>
        It took a month for us to work out what had caused the lash out. <br>
        It was a painful month, I questioned my judgment and wondered if I had done the right thing by not speaking up sooner. <br>
        However, as time passed, I came to terms with my decision. <br>
        While losing a friend was painful, I realized that I couldn't stay silent about something that I felt so strongly about. My values, such as loyalty and honesty, were more important to me than maintaining a friendship with someone who no longer seemed to share those values. <br>
        Thinking back on those few months, it taught me about the importance of standing up for what you believe in, <Br>
        Even when it's hard. <br>
        It also showed me the importance of surrounding myself with people who share my values, and still talking with people who don't so that you don't end up in a confirmation bias loop. <br>
        While I still miss the friend I once knew, I'm grateful for the lesson. </p>
        <h4>Strengths and Limitations</h4>
        <p>Figuring out my strengths felt a bit awkward, so I took online quizzes and chatted with friends and family. <br>
          Apparently, I'm a pretty focused and determined individual who thrives on challenges with a strong sense of justice. <br>
          I'm extroverted, being decisive and direct comes naturally to me. <br>
          In terms of learning, My focus helps me power through tough concepts, and challenges keep things interesting. <br>
          My directness allows me to set clear goals and ask for help without beating around the bush.<br>
          On the other hand, sometimes I come across as blunt or stubborn. I can get so focused that I miss the bigger picture. <br>
          Sarcasm also flies right over my head, which can make me seem insensitive. <br>
          I'm working on being more careful of how I come across, soften my approach and recognize different communication styles.<br>
          Sure, asking for clarification might ruin a joke sometimes, but for me, it's better than causing misunderstandings later on.

        <h4>Dealing with team resistance</h4>
        <p>
          When I was working in an outdoors store that was made up of a team of;<br>
          Half young Uni students (under 20) who don't know or care much about our products,<br>
          And half older people working full time with more experience in the individual field(s) of the tools and items we're selling, who had passion and personal bias about the products. <Br>
          Their was tension and distance in the age gap creating a slow and difficult to navigate work environment. <Br>
          I was young, but was working full time and had years of experience in our gears fields.<br>
          At the time my sense of justice might have been a little misplaced, and it defiantly wasn't my place to do as much as I did,<br>
          But I felt the need to do something, and I had the means to - so I tried something.<br>
          I started small, being more talkative to my coworkers.<br>
          I went out of my way to talk to EVERYONE. Really leant into the "personality hire" stereotype.<Br>
          Over a few weeks I;
          <ul>
            <li>Dressed more "fun" we had uniform t-shirts but other than that the only rule was "be modest" so out came puffy colorful and sometimes even sparkly skirts, light up shoes and fun jewelry.
            </li>
            <li>Started using the work group chat for celebrating fun little things ie; "Yay! I didn't find any stolen item tags in the changing room today!" or "Woah! Learnt a new hiking boots laces trick!"
            </li>
            <li>Adjusted the store playlist to be more up-to date radio safe pop.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This was making work more enjoyable, and I could see that the part timers attitude towards work changed the most.<br>
          Their was still the issue of people actually having some passion for the things we're trying to sell.<br>
          Involving them I started running education sessions in the first 15 min of work when it was the quietest. <br>
          We'd use a white board to go over a particular sport, product, or just a hard question someone had delt with.<br>
          I'd break it down, answer questions and put on a funny roleplay for the team. <br>
          I noticed the more I could get them to laugh about an item, the more they'd pay attention to what I was saying and hence the more of that item we would sell.<br>
          Looking back on it, If I needed to do this again I would talk to my managers about what I noticed and what I wanted to do first.<br>
          Hopefully I would have received more support and thus better results. <br>
          Either way I'm very happy that I did it, the store became a happier and more connected team - I also met one of my best friends during doing so. <br>
